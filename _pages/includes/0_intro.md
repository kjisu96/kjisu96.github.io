I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at [Kyungpook National University](http://en.knu.ac.kr/) <img src='./images/knu.jpg' style='width: 3em;'>, advised by Prof. [Daejin Park](https://ai-soc.github.io/) <img src='./images/lab.jpg' style='width: 5em;'> from Sep. 2019. I received a bachelor's degree of Electronics Engineering from the same university at Aug. 2019 (ealry graduation). 

My research mainly foceses on **efficient MCU, AP architecture**, with contributions in:

- ``SW`` ``FW`` Efficient MCU's firmware update: My work includes 
- `HW` Efficient hardware design: My work include Armv6 compatible ISA-based accelerator.
- `HW` `SW` Efficient software-embedded SoC verification platform: 
- `HW` Automotive IP RTL Design: My work include DSI3, SENT module design for automotive sensor ASICs.

My research aims to achieve **efficient AI accelerator utilization and virtualization by tightly-coupling all full-stack layers** of `HW`, `SW`, and `OS`. My 20+ published papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3Wz73U4AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fkjisu96%2Fkjisu96.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> will be the basis of my research goal.

I was selected as the first integrated B.S./M.S./Ph.D. student at university and was awarded a Ph.D. Research Fellowship from the [National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea](https://www.nrf.re.kr/eng/index).

I am currently seeking postdoctoral opportunities. If you have any advice or are interested in exploring academic collaborations, please feel free to read my CV and contact me. I look forward to your insights and suggestions.
